2. Build and test on iPhone 17 Pro simulator
3. Polish any rough edges
4. Show mom and watch her smile! 😊

### 💭 Reflections

This was an INCREDIBLE session! We built features that normally take days or weeks, all in one focused session. The parallel agent approach worked beautifully - each agent tackled a specific area of polish and they all came together into a cohesive, delightful experience.

Mom is going to LOVE using this app. Every tap, every swipe, every transition has been crafted with care and attention to detail. This is the kind of polish that makes users fall in love with an app!
